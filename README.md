> [!WARNING]
> I'm currently taking a break from Roblox, due to the [new anticheat update](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/an-update-on-automated-action-against-modified-clients/3640609) from Roblox that detects when you exploit (when you inject local scripts more specifically) on Roblox and can **IP ban** you. Right now, there are no safe options, so it's best that everbody waits until a bypass is being created.

Hello! If you are reading this, you are in my repository, where I host most of my scripts. Pastebin unfortunately takes down "malicious" lua code, even when it isn't.

I moved to GitHub because it is a safe place for exploiters to upload their scripts without getting any takedown requests or being falsely removed.

Most of the scripts here are obfuscated; **I take every single code here seriously and don't want any other people to take it.** I am currently using [MoonSec V3](https://discord.gg/kXqaQ2QzWz) for obfuscation.

Full List of my Active Scripts:
- [ü™ê Nexus Hub](https://github.com/jacklebeignet/scripts/blob/main/NexusHub/README.md)

Enjoy the scripts on here!
