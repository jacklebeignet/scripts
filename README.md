Hello! If you are reading this, you are in my repository, where I host most of my scripts. Pastebin unfortunately takes down "malicious" lua code, even when it isn't.

I moved to GitHub because it is a safe place for exploiters to upload their scripts without getting any takedown requests or being falsely removed.

Most of the scripts here are obfuscated; **I take every single code here seriously and don't want any other people to take it.** I am currently using [MoonSec V3](https://discord.gg/kXqaQ2QzWz) for obfuscation.

Full List of my Active Scripts:
- [ü™ê Nexus Hub](https://github.com/jacklebeignet/scripts/blob/main/NexusHub/README.md)

Enjoy the scripts on here!
