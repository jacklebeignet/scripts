# Scripts
Hello! If you are reading this, you are in my repository, where I host most of my scripts. Pastebin unfortunately sucks, and takes down "malicious" lua code, while it isn't. 

I moved to GitHub, since it is a safe place for exploiters to upload their script without getting any takedown and getting falsely removed.

Most of the scripts on here, are obsfucated; **I take every single code here important, and don't want any other people to take it.** I am currently using [MoonSec V3](https://discord.gg/kXqaQ2QzWz), which is a great obsfucator.

Full List of my Active Scripts:
- [Nexus Hub](https://github.com/jacklebeignet/scripts/blob/main/README.md#nexus-hub)

Enjoy the scripts on here!
