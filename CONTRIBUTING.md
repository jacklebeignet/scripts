# CONTRIBUTING.md
Certain scripts that I will post here, will **not be obfuscated**, which will mean they will be open source, and contributing.
To contribute, you need to do the follwing:
- Fork this repository
- Make any changes to the files
- Create a pull request and wait until I review it.

Your contribution must not make any breaking changes, not have sort of spyware, etc. If we find out about this, your pull request will be rejected.
